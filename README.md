Hi there! I'm Sahar Zar, and I've embarked on the 100 Days of Python journey by Angela Yu on Udemy.

Course Link: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I took this course to enhance my Python skills and build a solid portfolio of projects and exercises along the way.

This repository includes all of my work, notes, and projects as I progress through the course. Each project and exercise reflects the concepts learned and applied in the course.

Feel free to explore my projects and exercises! I welcome feedback and collaboration.

Thanks for visiting!
